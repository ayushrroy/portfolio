# Ayush Roy

Hi 👋 I'm Ayush. I work on:
- Real-time XR / VR systems (Quest Pro, Unity, gaze-based interaction)
- Rail maintenance AI (fluorescence sensing, Jetson Orin, signal processing)
- Automation / dashboards for operations and analytics

## Projects

**Rail Lubricity Monitoring**  
Built a pipeline that reads fluorescence signals from grease on rails, classifies them into green / yellow / red lubrication levels, and visualizes track health in real time using edge compute.

**Quadra — Collaborative XR Analytics Workspace**  
Unity + VR environment for exploring documents, clusters, and notes in 3D. Lets multiple people analyze info together in VR instead of on a 2D screen.

**Process Automation & Internal Tools**  
Built internal dashboards and data flows to cut manual data entry and make reports self-serve.
